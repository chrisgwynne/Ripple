# Ripple — Development Backlog

The prototype proves the foundation. Three phases follow.

## Session log

### 2026-07-10 — Phase 2 simulation: affairs, rumours, building repairs

No `./gradlew` wrapper was checked in, so the README's build instructions
didn't actually work and the test suite had apparently never been run
locally. Added the wrapper (Gradle 9.4.1) and got a real build/test loop
going (JDK 21 via the Android Studio bundled JBR, Android SDK), then worked
three Phase 2 **Simulation** backlog items end to end — implementation, a
`docs/simulation-rules.md` section, and a full local `testDebugUnitTest`
pass after each:

- **Affairs and their discovery.** New `RelationshipKind.AFFAIR`. A
  committed resident can drift into one when their existing partnership is
  *vulnerable* (low affection / high resentment) and not too closely
  watched — *vigilance* is a modifier on the existing `dependency` and
  `resentment` dimensions rather than a new tracked "jealousy" value, so it
  composes with everything already there. Affairs begin `HIDDEN`
  (`AFFAIR_BEGAN`), surface naturally (chance grows with the affair's own
  shared history and the deceived partner's vigilance) or via the `Reveal`
  intervention (now also checks for an ongoing affair, not just hidden
  health conditions), and discovery (`AFFAIR_DISCOVERED`) crashes
  trust/affection, spikes resentment, and has a 55% chance of ending the
  partnership via the existing separation/divorce path. See
  `docs/simulation-rules.md#affairs--jealousy`.
- **Rumour system.** New `RumourSystem`, run every tick. Gossip-worthy
  `PRIVATE` events (arguments, affairs discovered, break-ups, rivalries,
  secrets revealed…) can leak into a new `PUBLIC` `RUMOUR_SPREAD` event,
  which is the *only* way something private reaches `NewspaperGenerator` —
  the paper only ever reads public events. Leak chance comes from severity
  plus how many high-familiarity relationship edges surround those
  involved. ~55% of leaks are accurate paraphrases with a real cause link
  back to the truth; the rest are distorted (wrong resident dragged in,
  story downplayed or inflated) and carry **no** cause link, so the cause
  viewer never shows a false lineage for something that didn't really
  happen that way. See `docs/simulation-rules.md#rumours`.
- **Building lifecycle — repairs.** `Building.condition`, `.value` and
  `.visibleChanges` already existed and storm damage already lowered
  condition, but nothing ever raised it back up. New
  `BuildingLifecycleSystem` runs daily: any non-abandoned building below
  condition 55 looks for a payer (the trading business, or the wealthiest
  resident actually living there for homes) and, if they can afford
  `(100 − condition) × 9`, has a 15%/day chance of getting it fixed —
  condition rises 25–45, `BUILDING_REPAIRED` fires, and "Storm damage"
  clears from `visibleChanges`. Homes below condition 40 now also chip at
  residents' comfort, the same way persistent noise does, so this isn't
  purely cosmetic. Renovation choices, new construction and demolition are
  still open (see backlog item below). See
  `docs/simulation-rules.md#building-lifecycle`.

Also fixed a stale assertion in `CatchUpAndNewspaperTest` — it expected 120
in-game minutes for a 2-hour catch-up, but the documented 1s-real =
1min-game pacing makes the correct value 7200; the test's own comment had
simply confused hours and minutes.

**Discovered and flagged, not fixed** (confirmed pre-existing and unrelated
to the above via code-path analysis — none of them touch the systems
changed this session — and each spun off as a separate background task
rather than scope-creeping into this pass):
- `WorldGeneratorTest` "scenario seeds are planted" — two seeded buildings
  overlap in the default map layout (`WorldGenerator`'s placement logic).
- `GoalAndEconomyTest` "goals form from combined circumstances not
  randomness" — the seeded resident Ash Thistle forms `FIND_JOB` instead of
  the expected `START_BUSINESS` (`GoalSystem` condition logic or the seed
  data has drifted).
- `MigrationTest` "schema v1 matches..." — `FileNotFoundException`; the
  exported Room schema-v1 JSON the test reads was never generated or
  committed (`copyRoomSchemas` shows `NO-SOURCE`).

All work is committed on `claude/ripple-android-prototype-a0gsi8` (not
pushed): gradle wrapper + `.gitignore` cleanup, the three feature commits,
and the test fix.

**Not attempted this session:** everything else below. The remaining Phase
2 **Product** items need Compose/UI work or external art/audio assets;
Phase 3 and 4 are a substantially larger undertaking (generational systems,
local politics, an LLM narrative layer, etc.).

## Phase 2 — Depth of life (make watching richer)

**Simulation**
- [x] Affairs and their discovery (`AFFAIR_DISCOVERED` is already an event
  type); jealousy as a relationship dimension modifier. *Implemented:
  `RelationshipKind.AFFAIR`, vulnerability/vigilance modifiers in
  `InteractionSystem`, natural + `Reveal`-intervention discovery, fallout via
  `ConsequenceEngine`. See `docs/simulation-rules.md#affairs--jealousy`.*
- [x] Rumour system: private events leak along high-familiarity edges with
  accuracy loss; the newspaper can then be *wrong* (public understanding ≠
  facts, as designed). *Implemented: `RumourSystem`, `RUMOUR_SPREAD` events.
  See `docs/simulation-rules.md#rumours`.*
- Education/skill pipeline for children and teens; returning students
  (Kit-style leavers can come back changed).
- Richer crime: motives, suspicion, constable NPC role, false accusations.
- [~] Building lifecycle: repairs, renovation choices by owners, new
  construction on empty lots, demolition. *Repairs implemented
  (`BuildingLifecycleSystem`, `BUILDING_REPAIRED`, condition now affects home
  comfort) — see `docs/simulation-rules.md#building-lifecycle`. Renovation
  choices, new construction and demolition still open; the latter two need
  map/tile placement work, which is riskier while the building-overlap bug
  below is unresolved.*
- Seasonal events: harvest fair, winter market, floods by the river tiles.

**Product**
- Family tree visualisation (proper generational graph) and a relationship
  map canvas on the People screen.
- Cause viewer as a dedicated branching timeline UI (multi-parent display).
- Follow "moments": short vignette cards when the followed resident does
  something notable.
- Real local notifications (opt-in, POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission flow) for
  followed/favourite residents only, delivered on app open or via WorkManager
  summary — still no continuous background work.
- Sprite atlas support in `SpriteProvider` + commissioned pixel art replacing
  the procedural placeholders; walk cycles with 4 frames and directions.
- Sound: gentle ambient loops by time-of-day/weather.
- Benchmarks in CI (macrobenchmark for town rendering, JMH-style micro for
  ticks).

## Phase 3 — A town with a memory (systems that compound)

- Generational play: family reputation, inherited trauma/beliefs from
  memories, heirlooms; the death-of-followed flow grows into an "era summary".
- Local politics: council seats, petitions (noise, rents), policy effects on
  the economy; elections become campaigns influenced by reputation events.
- Economy v2: prices that move, property market (residents actually buy/sell
  homes), business succession and rivalries.
- Multiple towns: `World` already separates from `Town`; add a second map and
  slow migration between towns.
- Counterfactual viewer ("what nearly happened"): replay a checkpoint with
  one intervention removed — the deterministic engine makes this cheap.
  Strictly a *viewer*; never shown as future prediction.
- Cloud save via the existing `CloudSaveRepository` seam.
- Modding-friendly data: consequence rules and goal templates as data files.

## Phase 4 — The outside world (the seams come alive)

- `ExternalWorldEventProvider`: curated, abstracted real-world pressure feed
  (fuel prices rise → delivery costs rise → the chain the prototype already
  models). Strict mapping through `WorldPressureMapper`; no real names,
  no politics-of-the-day.
- `NarrativeTextProvider` / `DialogueProvider`: an LLM narrative layer that
  writes flavour prose and dialogue *from* facts, never creating facts —
  enforced by the existing engine-only-mutates rule and validated against the
  event log.
- National layer: lightweight country context (taxes, trends) as pressures.
- Shareable town chronicles: export a family's saga as text/images.

## Engineering debt to pay alongside

- Split packages into real Gradle modules once a second app target appears.
- Move mirror writes to incremental dirty-tracking instead of full rewrite at
  checkpoint.
- Pathfinding: replace L-paths with cached A* over the road graph when maps
  grow.
- Schema v2 migration + migration tests (baseline harness already in place).
- Baseline profile + R8 tuning for release builds.
- No gradle wrapper was checked in (`./gradlew` from the README didn't
  actually work) — now added. First real local test run surfaced three
  pre-existing failures, confirmed unrelated to Phase 2 simulation work via
  code-path analysis and flagged as background tasks: `WorldGeneratorTest`
  "scenario seeds are planted" (two seeded buildings overlap in the default
  map layout), `GoalAndEconomyTest` "goals form from combined circumstances
  not randomness" (Ash Thistle forms `FIND_JOB` instead of the expected
  `START_BUSINESS`), and `MigrationTest` "schema v1 matches..." (the
  exported Room schema-v1 JSON the test reads was never generated/committed).
